# Cloud Native - Fundemental Project

## Brief

The goal of this project is to create a CRUD application which utilises tools, methodologies and technologies provided by the core modules covered in training _so far_.

## Requirements 

I plan to meet the following requirements to ensure the success of my project:

* Jira board to display user stories, use cases and tasks that were completed
* A detailed Risk Assessment
* Clear doucumentation describing the architecture I will use for my project.
* A relational database used to persistently store data for my project.
* Functional application created in Java, following best industry practices and design principles.
* Functional front-end website and integrated API.
* Fully designed test suites - including automated tests for validation of the application.
* Ensure an acceptable level of test coverage in the back-end - Reports will be provided.
* Fully intergrated Version Control System.
* Code built through a CI server.
* Deploy application through a cloud-based virtual machine.

## Risk Assessment


## Jira Board

### User Stories


## Java
I will be creating the backend for my web application using the Java programming language using various plugins to aid in development and maintainence. My application will adhere to the various principles and standards we were introduced to during our training sessions thus far.


## Spring Framework
I will be using the spring framework to develop my Java backend as it simplfies the creation of projects by automating various configuration steps. This framework also handles a lot of procedures under the hood to allow for smoother development.

## HTML, CSS and Javascript

## Git and Github
